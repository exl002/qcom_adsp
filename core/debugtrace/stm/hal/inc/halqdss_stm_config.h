                       STM HAL CONFIGURE

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
   Contains  functionalities to access the 4KB of memory mapped STM register set 
that are connected through the APB bus. The STM hal is used by the STM 
configuration driver in order to enable the generation of software instrumented 
trace.  Functionalites exposed by the APIs include initializtion, wrappers to  
configure/Control, read/write into hardware registers.

/* 
Function Name: HAL_qdss_stm_HalConfigInit
    
Input:
   nBaseAddr: Base address of the STM hardware block to be used for computing 
register offsets.
 
Description: 
   Invoked by the driver to initialize the STM HAL module. The top level client 
must provide nBaseAddr identifying the register base address to be used in 
computing offsets. The HAL module SHOULD NOT reference the hardware by using 
physical address. 
   Internally the function obtains the base address of the STM hardware block 
and saves it to compute the register offsets.This API does NOT configure the 
STM hardware. Configuration of the STM block is the responsibility of the client 
driver which uses the HAL.
 
Return: None

Register (which controls write access to the STM registers). 
   STM hardware flushes its trace buffer to output pending writes to the ATB

Description: 
   Controls the selection of the port range that can be enabled/disabled

   Configures the STM Stimulus Port Select Configuration Register(STMSPSCR)

trace generation, the 64K ports per Master are organized into 32 ports per 
group. The bit fields in STMSPSCR register are highlighted below. The lower n 
bits of PORTSEL define the mask for the group interval. The b'1 at the n'th bit 
is a delimiter for the mask. Bits from (n+1) to m when concatenated with the 
mask provides the group selection range. Starting group-id is calculated by 
discarding the b'1 delimiter.
Example 1: PORTSEL=b'000000000001 implies select group b'00000000000. 
Translates to 32 ports starting at port 0.
Example 2: PORTSEL=b'000000000010 imples select group b'00000000000 to
