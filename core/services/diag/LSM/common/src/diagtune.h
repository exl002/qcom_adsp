when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ---------------------------------------------------------- 
05/09/13   sr      Added support for diag mask change notification for 
                   registered users 
12/13/12   rs      Added timeout mechanism to unblock diag in diagbuf_flush. 
10/15/12   rh      Changed NRT values for Diag draining. 
07/05/12   sg      Changes to bring up diag Multi PD
02/28/11   sg      Power saving changes
07/12/10   sg      Added log codes for DTV
06/14/10   is      Renamed FEATURE_WCDMA and FEATURE_GSM to internal Diag versions.
05/11/10   is      Mainlined LOG_EQUIP_ID_11_LAST_CODE
04/08/10   vs      Reduced drain timer len to 200
03/06/10   vg      Removed FEATURE_DTV 
01/10/10   vs      Removed include of log_codes_apps.h
09/09/09   JV      Moved diag_heap_size and diagbuf_size to the new diag_cfg.h
09/09/09   as      Moved DIAG packet TX and RX Max size macros to diagpkt.h
08/20/09   vs      Increased drain timer len to 500
07/21/09   mad     Mainlined last log code for equipment ID 1
07/12/09   mad     Featurized feature-dependencies for constants 
                   DIAGBUF_SIZE, DIAG_MAX_RX_PKT_SIZ
07/10/09   as      Removed support for FEATURE_DIAG_SPC_TIMEOUT
03/20/09   mad     Increased diag buf size to 128k
12/21/06   as      Changed diag drain timer timeout.
12/05/06   as      Added timeout for diag drain timer 
05/10/06   bt      Added support for DTV.
09/15/05   as      Changed diag SPC timeout for FEATURE_DIAG_SPC_TIMEOUT.
12/06/04   as      Added support for FTM (FEATURE_FACTORY_TESTMODE)
01/29/04   as      Corrected FEATURE, to fix DIAGBUF_SIZE definition
11/12/02   pj      Increased diagbuf size to 30KB for MS-Based
                   (FEATURE_GPSONE_PE).
05/31/02   ATM     Renamed FEATURE_GPLT to GSM_PLT
05/15/02   gsc     Make top level FEATURE symbol (FEATURE_GSM, FEATURE_WCDMA)
                   multi-mode compliant.
03/08/02   kar     Changes for RPC
02/06/02   ATM     Cleanup - renamed log codes to match convention
02/06/02   ATM     GPLT needed 1X codes temporarily till RPC is fixed
01/24/02   ATM     KOVU needs its own version of this tune file -- we don't need
                   other log codes from 1x/wcdma/etc...
11/16/01   gsc     Incorporated review comments from Ajit for changes
                   related to DIAGBUF_SIZE 
11/15/01   gsc     Added support for PLT (FEATURE_WPLT)
06/27/01   lad     Added multiple equip ID logging support.
                   Updated comments to be more useful.
04/17/01   lad     Added constants for event services.
02/23/01   lad     Created file.
