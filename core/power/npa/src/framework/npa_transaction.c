/* NPA notionally allows one active transaction per thread. However, 
   in practice, we did not support this. Given the lack of portable 
   thread-local-storage support across targets, we used a global transaction
   structure and lock to track transactions and thereby, restricted use of
   transactions to one active per system. In the 2012 branch, we remove
   this restriction, by using available TLS interfaces to support one active
   transaction per thread.

   In npa_transaction_init, we allocate a TLS key for use of transactions.
   Then in each thread, as a new transaction is begun, we save the transaction
   handle against this key. get_current_transaction retrieves the handle
   against this key from the TLS of the current thread. end_transaction sets
   this key in the TLS of the current thread to NULL.

 * 
 * Creation of the transaction handle may be expensive. A transaction
 * handle can be reused for multiple transactions, although any single
 * transaction must be completed before another transaction can be
 * started on the same handle.  If the transaction is created and used
 * within the driver function of a (locked) resource, transaction
 * atomicity will be implicit.
 *
 * The resource array passed into this function must remain valid for
 * the life of the transaction structure.
 *
 * If defined with the DEFAULT or LAZY_LOCKING attribute, it is the
 * responsibility of the person defining the transaction to understand
 * the implications of leaving resources locked beyond the duration of
 * the resource request.  This typically means understanding the
 * dependencies associated with your requests and what things will remain
 * locked, and in particular avoid having a circular path to the same
 * underlying resource, as this introduces an opportunity for deadlock.
 * 
 * If a request is issued to a resource that was defined without
 * locking, the resource will not be locked, although this should not
 * be a problem as lockless resources are either side-effect free or
 * not intended to be generally accessed.
 *
 * Note: the list of resources are all the resources that may be part
 * of this transaction.  Any particular transaction does not
 * necessarily have to access all of the resources that are defined as
 * part of the transaction, but any resources that are not defined as
 * part of the transaction will not be considered part of the
 * transaction.
