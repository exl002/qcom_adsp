/** \details
 * POSIX timers can be either of two types: a one-shot type or a periodic 
 * type.
 *
 * A one-shot is an armed timer that is set to an expiration time relative 
 * to either a current time or an absolute time. The timer expires once and 
 * is disarmed. 
 *
 * A periodic timer is armed with an initial expiration time and a repetition 
 * interval. Every time the interval timer 
 * expires, the timer is reloaded with the repetition interval. The timer 
 * is then rearmed.
