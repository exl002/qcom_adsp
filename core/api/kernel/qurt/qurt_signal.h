  Suspends the current thread until the specified signals are set.

  Signals are represented as bits 0-31 in the 32-bit mask value. A mask bit value of 1 indicates 
  that a signal is to be waited on, and 0 that it is not to be waited on.

  If a thread is waiting on a signal object for any of the specified set of signals to be set, 
  and one or more of those signals is set in the signal object, then the thread is awakened.

  If a thread is waiting on a signal object for all of the specified set of signals to be set, 
  and all of those signals are set in the signal object, then the thread is awakened.

  @note1hang At most one thread can wait on a signal object at any given time.
