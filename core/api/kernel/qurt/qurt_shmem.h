/**
 * The shm_open() function establishes a connection between a shared memory object and a file descriptor.
 * The file descriptor is used by other functions such as mmap() to refer to that shared memory object.
 * 
 *
 * @param name      Pointer to string naming a shared memory object. Name has to start with "/shm/"
 * @param oflag     File status flags and file access modes of the open file description. Following
 *                  flags are defined in <fcntl.h> and supported:
 *                  O_RDONLY: oepn for read access only
 *                  O_RDWR: Open for read or write access
 *                  O_CREAT: If shared memory object doesn't exist, create one.
 * @param mode      Permission flags (currently ignored)
 *
 * @return    file descriptor (positive number) if operation successful.
 *                  negative error code if failed

 * @param len       Specifies the lengh of the shared memory region.
 * @param prot      Describes the desired memory protection of the mapping. Same as the one in mmap of POSIX.
 * @param flags     Determines whether updates to the mapping is visible or not to other process. Same as
 *                  the one in mmap of POSIX.
 * @param fd        The starting adddress for the new mapping is returned.

 * restriction of single virtual address space.
