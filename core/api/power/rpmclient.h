/*
 * RPM Request Service API
 * 
 * This is the main RPM interface; it's used by NPA remoting and some drivers
 * to actually make requests of the RPM.  Internally the driver keeps a copy of
 * each request being made to the RPM and attempts to synchronize the desired
 * request state with the RPM's stored request state in the most efficient
 * manner possible.
 *
 * It's important to note that rpm_post_request returns immediately after
 * storing the request state *locally* -- before attempting to make use of the
 * resource you must call rpm_barrier on the returned message ID.  If you need
 * to immediately make use of the resource, the convenience macro
 * rpm_sync_request(set, resource, id, size, data) is available to perform both
 * steps in a single line of code.
