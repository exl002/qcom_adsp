/**
 * <!-- npa_define_transaction -->
 *
 * @brief Define a transaction with the list of resources that will be used in the transaction.
 * 
 * Creation of the transaction handle may be expensive. A transaction
 * handle can be reused for multiple transactions, although any single
 * transaction must be completed before another transaction can be
 * started on the same handle.  If the transaction is created and used
 * within the driver function of a (locked) resource, transaction
 * atomicity will be implicit.
 *
 * The resource array passed into this function must remain valid for
 * the life of the transaction structure.
 *
 * If defined with the DEFAULT or LAZY_LOCKING attribute, it is the
 * responsibility of the person defining the transaction to understand
 * the implications of leaving resources locked beyond the duration of
 * the resource request.  This typically means understanding the
 * dependencies associated with your requests and what things will remain
 * locked, and in particular avoid having a circular path to the same
 * underlying resource, as this introduces an opportunity for deadlock.
 * 
 * If a request is issued to a resource that was defined without
 * locking, the resource will not be locked, although this should not
 * be a problem as lockless resources are either side-effect free or
 * not intended to be generally accessed.
 *
 * Note: the list of resources are all the resources that may be part
 * of this transaction.  Any particular transaction does not
 * necessarily have to access all of the resources that are defined as
 * part of the transaction, but any resources that are not defined as
 * part of the transaction will not be considered part of the
 * transaction.
