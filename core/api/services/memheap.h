  @brief A simple sub-allocator to manage memory allocations and deallocations
  using a Next Fit strategy.

NOTE: The @brief description and any detailed descriptions above do not appear 
      in the PDF. 

      The Utility_Services_API_mainpage.dox file contains all file/group 
      descriptions that are in the output PDF generated using Doxygen and 
      Latex. To edit or update any of the file/group text in the PDF, edit 
      the Utility_Services_API_mainpage.dox file or contact Tech Pubs.

      The above description for this file is part of the "utils_memory" 
      group description in the Utility_Services_API_mainpage.dox file. 
===========================================================================*/
/*===========================================================================
 Note that these routines are FULLY re-entrant.  Furthermore, while
  performing memory allocation/deallocation calls on one heap, the routines
  may be interrupted to perform memory allocation/deallocation calls on
  different heaps without blocking or corruption.  However, should an
  interrupting task attempt to perform memory allocation/deallocation
  on the same heap that had a critical section interrupted, it will block
  allowing the first call to finish.  All this is accomplished by giving
  each heap its own semaphore.

FEATURE_MEMHEAP_MT
Activates multi threading support for the heap

  Usage Notes - Avoiding Fragmentation
 
1. If all bytes in the heap are freed, the heap is guaranteed to be returned
 to the same state as after a call to mem_init_heap, except that the
 values of maxUsed & maxRequest are not reset.  The order in which blocks
 are freed is irrelevant so long as they ALL are freed.
 
2. After n consecutive malloc/calloc calls, in a heap with non-fragmented
 free space (and no intervening realloc calls that return a new pointer),
 calling free in the reverse order on the n blocks guarantees that the heap
 will be returned to the exact same state as before the n alloc calls.
 
3. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 0
 (2) still applies, except the calls to free may be made in any order and
 after all n blocks are freed, the heap is guaranteed to be returned to the
 exact same state as prior to the n alloc calls.
 
4. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 1
 The overhead per heap block is 8 bytes.  However it's not possible to backup
 the next-block-to-start-searching-for-free-space pointer, so the heap MAY
 become more fragmented, but it MAY NOT -- it depends on the alloc/free
 calling patterns.
 
5. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 0
The overhead per heap block is 12 bytes.  Backing up is possible, so some
 fragmention that otherwise MIGHT occur can be prevented.  There is very little
 performance cost for this, the big expense is the additional 4 bytes of overhead
 per heap block.

  Resizes the ptr block of memory to size bytes while preserving the
  block's contents. 
 
  If the block is shortened, the bytes are discarded from the end. If the block
  is lengthened, the new bytes added are not initialized and will have 
  unrecognizable values. 
 
  This function has the following criteria: \n
  - If heap_ptr is NULL, the contents of ptr are unchanged and the function 
    silently returns NULL. 
  - If ptr is NULL, the function behaves exactly like mem_malloc(). 
  - If ptr is not NULL and size is 0, the function behaves exactly 
    like mem_free(). 
 
  If the block cannot be resized (i.e., ptr is not NULL and size is not 0), 
  NULL is returned and the original block is left untouched. If the ptr 
  block is successfully resized and the returned value is different from 
  the ptr value passed in, the old block passed in must be considered 
  deallocated and no longer useable; do NOT use mem_free() on the old block.  
 
  This function will ASSERT if it can detect a bad pointer or a pointer to a 
  free block within the range of memory managed by heap_ptr. However, 
  detection is not always possible. Passing in a ptr block that is outside 
  the memory managed by heap_ptr results in a silent return of NULL with 
  the contents of ptr unchanged. The function calls mem_malloc() if it cannot
  increase the block in place, so mem_allocator_failed_proc_type() WILL 
  be called to increase the block if the heap is out of room.

  @param[in] heap_ptr    Pointer to the heap from which to allocate.
  @param[in] ptr         Pointer to a block previously allocated.
  @param[in] size        Number of bytes to allocate.
