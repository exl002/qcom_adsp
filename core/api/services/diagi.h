when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
05/21/2010 SUG  Doxygenation Changes
09/30/09   JV      Removed FEATURE_DIAG_NV from this public header file. Removed
                   redundant prototype for diag_nv_read().
07/31/09   JV      Added FEATURE_DIAG_NV back (no NV functionality on the Q6)
07/31/09   JV      Merged Q6 diag code back to mainline
07/21/09   mad     Changed prototype of diag_wait to remove osal.h inclusion
07/15/09   mad     Removed un-necessary includes:diag.h,diagbuf.h,log.h
07/14/09   JV      Introduced osal.
07/10/09   as      Mainlined code under FEATURE_DIAG_NV
05/07/09   vk      removed dependencies from diagi_v.h 
12/12/08   vg      CMI creating diagi.h diagi_v.h
10/03/08   vg      Updated code to use PACK() vs. PACKED
11/21/06   as      Moved DIAG internal features from diagi.h to diag.h
08/28/06   as      Added win mobile featurization support.
03/28/06   pc      Changed DIAG_TX_APP_SIG from 0x00800000 to 0x00080000.
10/19/05   as      Modified diag_searchlist_type to make it 4-byte aligned.
07/05/05   sl      Added support for SPC_TIMEOUT to double the timeout value
                   on consecutive incorrect SPCs.
06/16/05   as      New signal for DM to communicate completion.
05/17/05   as      Added new signal for Application processor data.
10/24/01   jal     New signal for SIO to indicate the UART is flushed.
                   New signal for SIO to indicate port closure is complete.
08/20/01   jal     Supported more Diag packets.  Added NV cache typedef,
                   prototypes for diag_set_sp_state(), downloader status.
06/27/01   lad     Various non-functional changes to facilitate update of
                   log services.
04/06/01   lad     Added definitions of DIAG_TASK_xxx sigs to decouple from 
                   task.h.
                   ASYNC con<F2st definitions moved to diagcomm.h?
                   Externalized msg_nice[] and log_nice[] for streaming config 
                   support.
                   Moved prototype of diag_kick_watchdog() to diagtarget.h.
                   Added prototype of diagpkt_process_request() (moved from 
                   diagpkt.h).
                   Updated prototype for diag_do_escaping().
                   Removed prototype for diag_do_unescaping().
                   Removed references to diagpkt_refresh_cache().
02/23/01   lad     Rearchitected the diagnostics subsystem to be a service 
                   rather than a module.  All coupling to targets has been
                   moved to target-specific implementations.  The only coupling
                   that remains are common services and REX.
                   Old history comments have been removed since most of them
                   are no longer applicable.

    This procedure waits for specified signals to be set.  While it waits, 
    this procedure continues to set the Watchdog report signal and reset 
    the diag_rpt_timer. 
    
    To avoid deadlock situations, this function also waits on the MC task
    sigs.  Since diag doesn't really care when power goes away, the func
    immediately ack's MC.
    
    Depends on previously having used the diag_rpt_timer to time when to
    set the watchdog signal.
