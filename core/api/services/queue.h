22/03/12   rks     Use OSAL for OS abstraction and remove OS specific code/featurization
03/16/11   llg     (Tech Pubs) Edited/added Doxygen comments and markup.
11/11/10   EBR     Doxygenated File.

                   boolean
05/16/02    gr     Added macro Q_ALREADY_QUEUED.
09/28/01    gr     Merged in changes from the MSP archive. Includes
                   queue-specific mutual exclusion for Win32 targets and the

                   FEATURE_Q_NO_SELF_QPTR was not.
                   Introduced q_last_get().
                   Added extern "C" to allow this file to export the queue
                   routines to a C++ program.  Changed use of word to int to 
                   count the number of elements in a queue.  Upgraded comments
                   to include function headers.  Removed the inclusion of
                   comdef.h since it is no longer needed.
                   Added macros to support renaming of queue functions and
                   to intercept calls to queue functions.
