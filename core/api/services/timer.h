@brief
Implements various Timer APIs for various clients usage.

Timer groups are a way of enabling and disabling groups of timers at the same time. This is
 mainly used by the sleep subsystem to disable unwanted timers during sleep. For this reason, one
 should be careful which group their timer is set in, to help conserve power. 
 
When timer's are active, they live on the active list. When deactivated, they are moved to their appropriate timer group.
When a timer group is re-enabled, they are spooled back onto the active list. Timers that were pending expire once,
 while recurring ones get bumped to the future.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

timer_init() must be called once before any other timer functions.

timer_def() must be called, for each timer, 
before other timer functions are used with that timer.

timer_undef() must be called to free up the timer memory if the timer is not
required any more

A valid sclk estimate is needed before timers can be set.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  Implements the timer functions


REGIONAL FUNCTIONS

  timer_init()
    Initializes the timer subsytem.  Call only from time_init( ).

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS

  timer_def(timer, group, tcb, sigs, func, data)
    Defines and initializes a timer.

  timer_def2(timer, group, func, data)
    Defines and initializes a timer, with the clock callback semantics.

  timer_set(timer, ticks, reload, unit)
    Sets an inactive timer to expire after a given period of time, or changes
    an active timer to expire after a given period of time.
    Optionally, specifies the timer to repeatly expire with a given period.

  timer_get(timer, unit)
    Get number of timer units before timer expires

  timer_pause(timer)
    Suspends an active timer

  timer_resume(timer)
    Resumes a previously "paused" active timer.

  timer_clr(timer, unit)
    Stops an active timer

  timer_clr_task_timers(tcb)
    Stops all active timers which belong to the specified task.

  timer_group_enable(timer_group)
    Enables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group which expired during the
    diabled period will have their expiry processing executed.

  timer_group_disable(timer_group)
    Disables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group will continue to count
    down, but they will not expire.


INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

    timer_init() must be called once before any other timer functions.

    timer_def() must be called, for each timer, before other timer
    functions are used with that timer.

    A valid sclk estimate is needed before timers can be set.

Amount of time in specified unit remaining before expiry.
0 will be returned for an expired timer or invalid timer. 

@note1hang
- If the timer_clr api is called at the moment of timer being expired
there can be chances that timer gets expired first and then timer_clr
will simply return 0 as timer got expired but callback/signal calling can be
running on parallel thread. Therefore, it is always advised to check if there
is sufficient time(ex: 1msec or few ticks) before calling this api.
timer_get_64() can be used to check how much time is still left for the expiry.
