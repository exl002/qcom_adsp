/**
  Opens a shared memory port identified by the name and direction. It must be

  @param[in] port_name         Name of the SMD port. The same name must be used 
                               by both processors for a particular port. The 
                               length of the name is defined as 
                               SMD_CHANNEL_NAME_SIZE_MAX, where the last

                               whitespace in port_name.
  @param[in] channel_type      Port connection type; specifies the connection 
                               direction.
  @param[in] tx_callback_fn    Called when the previous transmit buffer 
                               (if any) has been copied to shared memory. The
                               callback should provide the next buffer (and the
                               buffer size) to send. If no buffer is provided, 
                               smd_notify_write must be called when a new 
                               transmit buffer is available.\n 
                               The call to smd_notify_write causes the SMD task 
                               to call this callback to get the buffer. This 
                               callback is called in the SMD task context and 
                               <i>must not block or wait</i>.
  @param[in] tx_callback_data  A pointer to the client tx_callback_fn data.
  @param[in] rx_callback_fn    Called when the SMD has finished writing data 
                               into the previous receive buffer (if any). It is 
                               called with the number of bytes written into the 
                               previous buffer. The callback is to provide the 
                               next read buffer and the space available in the 
                               buffer. If the number of bytes written is zero, 
                               there was no previous buffer. If no buffer is 
                               provided, smd_notify_read must be called when a 
                               new receive buffer is available.\n 
                               The call to smd_notify_read causes the SMD task 
                               to call this callback to get the buffer. This 
                               callback is called in the SMD task context and 
                               <i>must not block or wait</i>.
  @param[in] rx_callback_data  Pointer to the client rx_callback_fn data.
  @param[in] rx_flowctl_fn     Called when rx_callback_fn returns a NULL buffer 
                               and flow control is not enabled. Flow control 
                               not enabled means that pending data should be 
                               thrown away if there is nowhere to put the 
                               data.\n 
                               This function allows the user to specify how 
                               much data to throw way for maintaining packet 
                               synchronization. The function is called with the 
                               number of bytes pending and returns the number 
                               of bytes to skip.\n 
                               For streaming-mode streams, you typically skip 
                               all of the pending bytes.\n
                               This callback is called in the SMD task context 
                               and <i>must not block or wait</i>.
  @param[in] rx_flowctl_data   Pointer to the client rx_flowctl_fn data.

  @return
  SMD port ID of the newly-opened port.

  @dependencies
  Shared memory must have been initialized on this processor by calling

  @param[in] channel_type      Port connection type; specifies the connection 
                               direction.
  @param[in] tx_callback_fn    Called when the previous transmit buffer (if any) 
                               has been copied to shared memory. The callback is 
                               to provide the next buffer (and the buffer size) 
                               to send. If no buffer is provided, 
                               smd_notify_write must be called when a new 
                               transmit buffer is available.\n 
                               The call to smd_notify_write causes the SMD task 
                               to call this callback to get the buffer. This 
                               callback is called in the SMD task context and 
                               <i>must not block or wait</i>.
  @param[in] tx_callback_data  A pointer to the client tx_callback_fn data
  @param[in] rx_callback_fn    Called when the SMD has finished writing data
                               into the previous receive buffer (if any). It is
                               called with the number of bytes written into the
                               previous buffer. The callback should provide the
                               next read buffer and the space available in the
                               buffer. If the number of bytes written is zero, 
                               there was no previous buffer. If no buffer is 
                               provided, smd_notify_read must be called when a
                               new receive buffer is available.\n 
                               The call to smd_notify_read causes the SMD task 
                               to call this callback to get the buffer. This 
                               callback is called in the SMD task context and 
                               <i>must not block or wait</i>.
  @param[in] rx_callback_data  A pointer to the client rx_callback_fn data
  @param[in] rx_flowctl_fn     Called when rx_callback_fn returns a NULL buffer 
                               and flow control is not enabled. Flow control 
                               not enabled means that pending data should be 
                               thrown away if there is nowhere to put the 
                               data.\n 
                               This function allows the user to specify how 
                               much data to throw way for maintaining packet 
                               synchronization. The function is called with the 
                               number of bytes pending and returns the number 
                               of bytes to skip. For streaming-mode streams, 
                               you typically skip all of the pending bytes.\n
                               This callback is called in the SMD task context 
                               and <i>must not block or wait</i>.
  @param[in] rx_flowctl_data   Pointer to the client rx_flowctl_fn data.
  @param[in] fifo_sz           SMD FIFO size. The FIFO size must be a multiple
                               of 32 and must not be greater than
                               #SMD_MAX_FIFO.

  @return
  SMD port ID.

  @dependencies
  Shared memory must have been initialized on this processor by calling 
  smem_init().\n 
  The SMD must be up and running. The startup process is platform specific.

@deprecated   This function is deprecated; new code should use

===========================================================================*/
/*!
@brief
  Opens a shared memory port identified by the name and edge with optional
  parameters.

  This function must be called before any other operations are done on that
  port. 

@param[in]  port_name           The name of the SMD port. The same name must
                                be used by both processors for a particular
                                port. The length of the name is defined as
                                SMD_CHANNEL_NAME_SIZE_MAX, where the last 
                                character is always null. Do not use 
                                whitespace in port_name.

@param[in]  channel_type        The port connection type, specifies the
                                connection direction.  

@param[in]  callback_data       A pointer to the client data passed to all
                                three client callback functions.

@param[in]  tx_callback_fn      This function is called when the previous
                                transmit buffer (if any) has been copied to
                                shared memory. The callback should provide the
                                next buffer(and the buffer size)to send.  If
                                no buffer is provided, then smd_notify_write
                                must be called when a new transmit buffer is
                                available. The call to smd_notify_write will
                                cause the SMD task to call this callback to
                                get the buffer.  This callback is called in
                                the SMD task context and MUST NOT BLOCK OR
                                WAIT.

@param[in]  rx_callback_fn      This function is called when SMD has finished
                                writing data into the previous receive buffer
                                (if any). It is called with the number of
                                bytes written into the previous buffer. The
                                callback should provide the next read buffer
                                and the space available in the buffer.If the
                                number of bytes written is zero, then there
                                was no previous buffer. If no buffer is
                                provided, then smd_notify_read() must be
                                called when a new receive buffer is available.
                                The call to smd_notify_read() will cause the
                                SMD task to call this callback to get the
                                buffer.  This callback is called in the SMD
                                task context and MUST NOT BLOCK OR WAIT.

@param[in]  rx_flowctl_fn       This function is called when rx_callback_fn
                                returns a NULL buffer and flow control is not
                                enabled. Flow control not enabled means that
                                pending data should be throw away if there's
                                nowhere to put the data. rx_flowctl_fn is
                                called with the number of bytes pending and
                                returns the number of bytes to skip.  For
                                packet mode streams, this can be used to keep
                                packet sync. by skipping bytes to the next
                                header.  For stream mode stream, you typically
                                skip all of the pending bytes.  This callback
                                is called in the SMD task context and MUST NOT
                                BLOCK OR WAIT.

@param[in]  smd_param           Optional paramaters used to configure the SMD
                                port. If this pointer is NULL, the default
                                values will be used instead. See \a
                                smd_open_param_type for detailed documentation
                                on using the optional paramaters.
