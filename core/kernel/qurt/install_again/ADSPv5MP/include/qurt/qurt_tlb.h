/**
  @file qurt_tlb.h 

  @brief  Prototypes of TLB API  
		The following APIs allow explicit control of the portion of TLB that between TLB_firs_replaceble and TLB_LAST_REPLACEABLE. 
		Both are non-configurable for the time being. This portion of TLB is permanently assigned/locked unless manually removed 
		by qurt_tlb_remove. Implementation does not change depending on the configuration, i.e. whether CONFIG_STATIC is set or not. 
		In CONFIG_STATIC=y, TLB_LAST_REPLACEABLE is set to the last tlb index, which indicates that the entire TLB is permanently 
		assigned and is not backed up by pagetable (pagetable does not exist). TLB indecies are maintained through a 64-bit bitmask. 
		A new entry is placed in the first available free slot. 

EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS
