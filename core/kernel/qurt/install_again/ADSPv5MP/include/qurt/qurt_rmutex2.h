  @note1cont Recursive mutexes must not be destroyed while they are still in use. If this
             happens the behavior of QuRT is undefined. 
  @note1cont In general, application code should "destroy" an rmutex2 object prior to
             deallocating it; calling qurt_rmutex2_destroy() before deallocating it ensures
             that all qurt_rmutex2_unlock() calls have completed.

/**@ingroup func_qurt_rmutex2_lock
  Locks the specified recursive mutex. \n 

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a recursive mutex that is not being used, the
  thread gains access to the shared resource that is protected by the mutex, and continues
  executing.

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a recursive mutex that is already being used by
  another thread, the thread is suspended. When the mutex becomes available again
  (because the other thread has unlocked it), the thread is awakened and given access to the
  shared resource.
  
  @note1hang A thread is not suspended if it locks a recursive mutex that it has already
             locked, but the mutex does not become available until the thread performs a
             balanced number of unlocks on the mutex.

   @param[in]  lock  Pointer to the recursive mutex object to lock.

   Unlocks the specified recursive mutex. \n 
   More than one thread can be suspended on a recursive mutex. When the mutex is
   unlocked, only the highest-priority thread waiting on the mutex is awakened. If the
   awakened thread has higher priority than the current thread, a context switch occurs.
