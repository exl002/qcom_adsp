  @description
    This command allows one or more parameters to be set on a stream. It
    is typically used to apply calibration data to the modules.
    @par
    @keep{6} Messages can be in-band or out-of-band via shared memory.
    - In-band set parameter -- In this mode, the memory map handle is set to
      NULL. The rest of the payload contains the parameters as shown in the
      variable payload structure (parameter data).
    - Shared memory set parameter -- In this mode, the physical/virtual address
      to the parameter data and the data payload size are sent. The rest of the
      message is inside the shared memory in the variable payload format.
      The memory content is the same as the in-band payload parameter data.
    - For shared memory, Voice services invalidate the cache line before
      reading the content of the memory. The memory map handle determines the
      type of address, i.e., virtual, physical, etc. A physical address is
      translated to a virtual address before the service invalidates the cache.

  @description
    This command allows the client to push buffers in the specified direction
    to be used by the firmware in the host PCM processing timeline. In the read
    direction, the buffer specifies a physical address in shared memory to be
    filled. In the write direction, the buffer specifies a physical address in
    shared memory of the data to inject into the tap point for downstream
    processing. Currently, the host PCM operates on a default 20&nbsp;ms basis
    for each tap point.
    @par
    Read buffers must be aligned to 32-byte boundaries for cache purposes
	(unless the property_flag is set to #VOICE_LOCAL_HEAP_MEM_ADDR),
    while write buffers must be aligned to 4-byte boundaries. Read and write
    buffers must have been mapped previously via 
    #VOICE_CMD_SHARED_MEM_MAP_REGIONS.
    @par
    The firmware maintains independent read and write buffer queues for each
    tap point. When the firmware receives this VOICE_EVT_PUSH_HOST_BUF_V2 event,
	it attempts to push the corresponding buffer as indicated in the mask field.
    @par
    @keep{8} If there is an internal queue overflow, the client is notified
	immediately that the buffer can be reclaimed via
	#VOICE_EVT_HOST_BUF_AVAILABLE_V2. Otherwise, the buffer is pushed to the
	proper queue. Currently, the firmware supports only one buffer at a time
	on each path to ensure minimum delay.
    @par
    Pushed buffers are dequeued at the operating timeline of the specified tap
    point, and then they are processed. A notification is sent to the client
    via #VOICE_EVT_HOST_BUF_AVAILABLE_V2 so the buffers can be reclaimed by the
    client. Buffers must be consistent with the host PCM configuration and

  @description
    Based on the mask field, the client can reclaim the buffers (used by the
    firmware) for its buffer pool. The memory map handle defines this
    property for the shared memory buffer, e.g., virtual/physical/local.  
    @par
    Any mask field that contains bits other than a timing tick indicates that
    a corresponding buffer has been used and can be reclaimed. The client can
    read out the corresponding fields.
    @par
    - If the read mask is set, the read-related fields represent information
      of the filled buffer at the physical address specified, and the buffer
      can be reclaimed.
    - If the write mask is set, the buffer specified at the physical address
      can be reclaimed in the client's buffer pool. The write-related fields
      represent buffer size and format information requested by firmware for
      the next write buffer pushed.
    @par
    @keep{8} If the mask field only contains the timing tick, the firmware did
    not use any buffers and there is nothing to be reclaimed by the client.
    However, if the write direction at the specified tap point is active, the
    write-related fields represent buffer size and format information
    requested for the next write buffer pushed.
    @par
    Notify events are typically sent at the same processing timeline as the
    selected tap point, so they can be used as a trigger for the client
    buffer exchange. When initially starting a host PCM session, the
    firmware does not have buffers available, and it sends a notify event
    with only the timing tick set in the mask to initiate client buffer
    transfer and to specify any applicable write buffer requirements.
    @par
    - If a pushed read buffer is inconsistent with the host PCM configuration
    and size requirements, the notify event indicates the buffer can be
    reclaimed and that zero bytes were read out. Also, the read error bit is
    set.
    - @keep{4} If a pushed write buffer is inconsistent with the host PCM
      configuration and size requirements, the notify event still indicates
      the requested configuration and size requirements for the next write
      buffer pushed. In this case, the write error bit is set.
    @par
    Notify events are not given for any queued buffer that the firmware is
    holding if either the host PCM is stopped or the device/stream session
    is destroyed successfully. In these cases, the successful response to
    either the stop host PCM command or the destroy command is to be used as
    an indication that all client buffers can be reclaimed.
    @par
    If the client attempts to push buffers to the firmware and it overflows
    the firmware's internal buffer queue, the notify event comes back
    immediately to indicate the buffer can be reclaimed.

  @return
    None.

    A valid session must have been created.
