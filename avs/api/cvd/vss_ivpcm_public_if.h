  @par Payload
  #vss_ivpcm_cmd_start_v2_t

  @return
  #APRV2_IBASIC_RSP_RESULT

  @dependencies
  Shared memory that will be used for vocoder PCM data buffer transfers must 
  first be mapped with CVD by following @latexonly \hyperref[shmem_guideline]
  {Shared Memory Usage Guideline} @endlatexonly. The memory must be valid until
  #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_STOP is successfully completed. If destroying the a CVD module
  session while vocoder PCM is running, the memory must be valid until 
  #APRV2_IBASIC_CMD_DESTROY_SESSION is successfully completed.

  @comments
  This command is used to start a vocoder PCM session by specifying one or more
  PCM tap points and a handle to the shared memory that will be used for 
  vocoder PCM data buffer transfers. Only one vocoder PCM start is supported by
  the CVD module session at any given time. During device switch, client has to
  stop and re-configure vocoder PCM. Otherwise, for any configuration changes 
  during device switch, client has to check the new configuration information 
  from #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event.

/**
  Per tap-point vocoder PCM notification issued by CVD, providing a buffer
  transfer notification to the client. Additionally, this notification is
  overloaded to provide timetick and various information to the client, 
  depending on the use case, such as: requested output buffer size, requested
  input buffer size and sampling rate, input buffer consumed notification, 
  output buffer filled notification. The interpretation of this notification is
  indicated by the notify_mask in the payload.

  If the timetick bit of notify_mask is set, this notification is used as a 
  timetick which is issued to the client every 'x' milliseconds, where 'x' is
  the PCM frame size which the VDSP operates on, and denotes the boundary upon
  which PCM buffer transfers between the client and CVD occur. If the timetick
  bit is not set, notify event is used for buffer notifications only. In case 
  of output or input error in buffer operation, the correponding error bit will
  be set in the notify_mask.

  Each notify event can accommodate any combination of timetick, output buffer 
  filled or input buffer consumed masks.

  @par Payload
  #vss_ivpcm_evt_notify_v2_t

  @return
  None.

  @dependencies
  None.

  @comments
  After a VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2 command is issued, buffer transfer between the
  client and CVD commences when the first #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event is 
  received by the client (it cannot start prior to receiving the first event).
  First notification is for buffer setup information only. The interpretation 
  of the #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event and the information conveyed by it to
  the client depends on the use case and the time when it is issued:

  USE CASE 1 -- Output only tap point:

    - First #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2
        - notify_mask = 0
        - Indicates the requested size of the output buffer to be provided by 
          the client.
    - Subsequent #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 events
        - notify_mask bit 0 set
        - Indicates the previously provided output buffer has been filled and 
          its sampling rate and number of channels are as speciffied by the 
          sampling_rate and num_out_channels fields. Also indicates the size of
          the next output buffer to be provided by the client.

  USE CASE 2 -- Input only tap point:

    - First #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2
        - notify_mask = 0
        - Indicates the requested size and sampling rate of the input buffer to
          be provided by the client.
    - Subsequent #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 events
        - notify_mask bit 1 set
        - Indicates the previously provided input buffer has been consumed.
          Also indicates the size and sampling rate of the next input buffer to
          be provided by the client.

  USE CASE 3 -- Output-input tap point:

    Sampling rate of the input and output must always be the same in this case.

    - First #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2
        - notify_mask = 0
        - Indicates the requested size of the output buffer to be provided by 
          the client.
    - Second #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2
        - notify_mask bit 0 set
        - Indicates that the first provided output buffer has been filled and 
          its sampling rate and number of channels are as speciffied by the 
          sampling_rate and num_out_channels fields. Also indicates the size
          and sampling rate of the first input buffer to be provided by the 
          client.
    - Subsequent #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 events
        - notify_mask bits 0 and 1 both set
        - Indicates the previously provided output buffer has been filled and 
          its sampling rate and number of channels are as specified by the 
          sampling_rate and num_out_channels fields.
          Also indicates the previously provided input buffer has been 
          consumed. Also indicates the requested size of the next output buffer
          and the requested size and sampling rate of the next input buffer.
