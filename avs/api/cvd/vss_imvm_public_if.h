  Stream and vocproc calibration is depenedent on the tx/rx sampling rate. It is

  for two purposes:
  
    1. Determining the tx and rx sample rates that the system should run at/be

       to it for purposes of configuring their sample rates and indenxing into the
       calibration table to apply the corresponding calibration data subset. 
       (This is in the case of fixed sample rate vocoders. In the case of variable
       sample rate vocoders, the MVM cannot determine the sample rates from the 
       media type alone and requires the sample rates to be provided by the client:
       see #VSS_IMVM_CMD_SET_CAL_VAR_VOC_SAMPLING_RATE)
    
    2. Determing the vocoder class and propagating it to the stream/s and vocproc/s
       attached to it for purposes of indexing into the calibration table to apply 
       the corresponding calibration data subset.
