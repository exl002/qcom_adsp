  @keep{8} @detdesc
    If the client wants the aDSP to use valid timestamps in this command and
    the data being sent through this command is in RAW format, the last data
    byte must constitute an end of frame. The end-of-frame flag (bit&nbsp;4
    of the flags field) must be set to 1. Otherwise, the aDSP will not
    be able to handle the timestamps correctly, which may result in gaps during
    audio playback.
    @par
    When the buffer delivers uncompressed PCM data (i.e.,
    #ASM_MEDIA_FMT_MULTI_CHANNEL_PCM_V2 format), the buffer must contain the
	same number of PCM samples for all channels. If not, the aDSP discards the
	buffer and generates an	#ASM_DATA_EVENT_WRITE_DONE_V2 event with the
	ADSP_EBADPARAM error code. (For more details on the error code, refer to
	@xhyperref{Q5,[Q5]}.)

    

  @return
    #ASM_DATA_EVENT_WRITE_DONE_V2 is raised when the buffer is fully consumed.

  @dependencies
    The session/stream must be a valid and opened write or read/write 
    session/stream.

         The timestamp of the first sample in this buffer continues from the
         timestamp of the last sample in the previous buffer. If there is no
         previous buffer (i.e., this is the first buffer sent after opening
         the stream or after a flush operation), or if the previous buffer
         does not have a valid timestamp, the samples in the current buffer
         also do not have a valid timestamp. They are played out as soon as
         possible.

         @subhd{If bit 31=0 and bit 29=0}
         No timestamp is associated with the first sample in this buffer. The
         samples are played out as soon as possible.

         @subhd{If bit 31=1 and bit 29 is ignored}
         The timestamp specified in this payload is honored.

         @subhd{If bit 30=0}
         This is not the last buffer in the stream. This is useful in
         removing trailing samples.

         @subhd{For bit 4}
         The client can set this end-of-frame flag for every buffer sent in
         which the last byte is the end of a frame. If this flag is set, the
         buffer can contain data from multiple frames, but it must always end
         at a frame boundary. Restrictions allow the aDSP to detect an end of
         frame without requiring additional processing. */
