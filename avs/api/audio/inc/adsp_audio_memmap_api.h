         Bit 0 is the IsVirtual flag that indicates physical or virtual mapping:
           - 0 -- The shared memory address provided in
                  avs_shared_map_regions_payload is a physical address. The
                  shared memory must be mapped (a hardware TLB entry), and a
                  software entry must be added for internal bookkeeping.
           - 1 -- The shared memory address provided in the map
                  payload[usRegions] is a virtual address. The shared memory
                  must not be mapped (because the hardware TLB entry is already
                  available), but a software entry must be added for internal
                  bookkeeping. \n
                  This is useful if two services within the aDSP are
                  communicating via the APR. They can directly communicate via
                  the virtual address instead of the physical address. The
                  virtual regions must be contiguous.
