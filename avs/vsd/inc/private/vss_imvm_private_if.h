  This event informs the CCM of the current configuration of the MVM session
  (i.e. the number of nb/wb+ streams/vocproc connected to it). In response to
  this event the CCM performs the following two actions:
 
    1. Sets the VDSP clock.
 
    2. Broadcasts #VSS_ICCM_EVT_ACTIVE_SESSIONS event to all the currently
       active MVM sessions in the system (including the one that originated
       this event), informing them of the total number of streams and vocprocs
       in the system as well as the current VDSP clock.
 
   Based on the concurency information received in the #VSS_ICCM_EVT_ACTIVE_SESSIONS
   event, each MVM session configures the voice path timing offsets for the
   streams and vocprocs connected to it.

  This command is generated when the MVM session is notified by one of the

  topology, sample rates and/or KPPS requirements) has changed, which requires 
  MVM to re-calculate the timing offsets for this session, as well report the 
  configuration changes to the CCM, so that the CCM may set the clocks 
  accordingly and notify all other MVM sessions of the changes.
